				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I started my web development career a year ago. It was Codecademy which helped me learning basic HTML and CSS . It was the first time I was seeing myself coding.
				And then the journey continued.</p>
				<p>
				After completing HTML and CSS and Javascript at Codecademy , I came to Treehouse and started learning front-end-technology. After joining Treehouse , I never looked back. I am learning everyday to become a become a great Front-end-develper. I am looking for Javascript as my next goal on Treehouse.</p>
				<p>
				I love reading books specially Philosophy books because there is something to know about this world and ourselves. Beside coding , I love reading books and writing.</p>

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>My Goal is to become a FULL STACK DEVELOPER . As this is a long journey so I am taking single step at a time .

				<ul>
